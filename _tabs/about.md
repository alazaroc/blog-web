## Me

I will try to keep it short: I am a Cloud & Software Architect **specialised in AWS**, I have 5 AWS certifications (the 3 associate and the 2 professional) and I'm working with AWS. You can find more information about my professional experience in my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-lazaro-chueca/){:target="_blank"}. Of course, I'll be happy to connect with anyone interested.

## The Blog

- The main goal is to **create periodic content related to AWS** and share publicly.
- The secondary goal is to have an excuse to continue learning and practicing with AWS resources.
- I'll try to be short and direct. I like the TLDR-summary.
- This is a **personal blog**:
  - All the opinions are on my own
  - All the content is created in my free time
  - I don’t want to sell you anything
  - I don’t expect any income from the blog
  - I just want to share knowledge and learn together
- The Technology Behind This Blog is detailed [here](/posts/the-technology-behind-this-blog/){:target="_blank"}
  - This is a first version, I will improve it!
